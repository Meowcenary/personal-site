<h2>Internships</h2>

    <b>Crowe Horwath</b>
    <br/>
    Chicago, Illinois
    <br/>
    <i>Jun-August 2015</i>
    <p>
        Worked on three projects at Crowe. The first involved integrating essential functionality of a legacy web
        application into it's successor. Most work on this project involved back end server code written in C# with
        minor adjustments on the front end with Angular JS. The second project was Quality Assurance (QA) work for a
        freshly launched web application. The project involved verifying that downloaded data remained consistent with
        online data after processing. Worked to automate the data comparison process to increase productivity. The final
        project continued work developing web pages in C# and Angular JS for the legacy application integration with a
        focus on creating new features.

<h2>Projects</h2>
<div>
    <b>Ruby Rogue</b>
    <p>
        The classic game of Rogue implemented in Ruby using the "curses" programming library for terminal graphics. I'm
        hopeful that I'll continue adding to this when I have some time, but in it's current state it's very basic only
        allowing for movement and simple maps.
    </p>
    <b>Hexagonal Grid</b>
    <p>
        Interactive hexagonal grid written in Javascript. The grid size can be adjusted and when a hexagon is clicked it
        will highlight the hexagon itself and the surrounding hexagons. The original intention was to use this for
        different games I was working on, but I switched to using Python's Pygame library. Still a helpful example to
        keep around.
    </p>
    <b>Dash Pictures</b>
    <p>
        This project was built for a small hackathon I participated in. Amazon had recently released their Dash Buttons,
        buttons that when pressed would connect to wifi to place an order for whatever product the button was linked to
        (E.g a Tide Dash Button would place an order for Tide detergent). We created a simple Python script to run on a
        jailbroken iPhone that would listen for a signal from a registered Dash Button and then take picture when it was
        received.
    </p>
    <b>BrowsVR</b>
    <p>
        This project was built for the inaugural SpartaHack, Michigan State's annual hackathon. Using the Oculus Rift,
        we built a small scene of a room with a large screen displaying a web browser. As the user visited different
        sites the room would update the decor based on the site visited. It was an ambitious idea and won us third place,
        but the functionality was fairly limited and I have not worked with an Oculus Rift since.
