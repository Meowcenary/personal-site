Sports
---

My two favorite sports are football and baseball and my favorite team for each are the Green Bay Packers and the Chicago
White Sox.

I have been a Packers fan since I was a kid because my parents grew up Green Bay and I have consistently made
it to at least one game a season for years now. While I can't make most games, I do make it a point to watch at home
when I can with friends and family.

The White Sox are a team that I started cheering for after moving to Chicago. The Cubs are the more popular team, but in
my opinion Guaranteed Rate Field is one of the best places to watch a baseball game. I go to many baseball games each
season and love keeping up with the stats.


Board Games, Miniatures, and Tabletop RPGs
---

I've loved playing board games since I was a young kid and have carried that into adulthood. I'll play almost anything
from Chess to modern games like Twilight Imperium, but my favorite games are head-to-head strategy games. In addition to
board games, I also play miniatures games such as Battletech and Warhammer 40k that give me a chance to build and paint
models and table top RPGs like Dungeons and Dragons. I don't have as much time to play games as I used to, but I still
make a point of getting together with friends at least once a month.

Piano
---

I started playing piano in late 2020 with a basic keyboard I had. After a few months of playing around with it at home I
decided to sign up for lessons and have stuck with it since. While I don't think it's realistic I'll ever perform in a
serious setting, I really enjoy seeing myself improve and playing for my wife and cats.
