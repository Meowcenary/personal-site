These are some of the more interesting side projects that I've worked on. My other side projects can be viewed on my
Github page that is linked on the sidebar

- [**Ruby Rogue**](https://github.com/Meowcenary/ruby_rogue)
The classic game of Rogue implemented in Ruby using the "curses" programming library for terminal graphics. I'm hopeful
that I'll continue adding to  using the requests library this when I have some time, but in it's current state it's very
basic only allowing for movement and simple maps.

- [**py_server**](https://github.com/Meowcenary/py_server)
A very basic web server to host static pages and list files written in Python using the requests library for a lunch and
learn presentation.

- [**Dash Pictures**](https://devpost.com/software/dash-pictures)
This project was built for a small hackathon I participated in. Amazon had recently released their Dash Buttons, buttons
that when pressed would connect to wifi to place an order for whatever product the button was linked to (E.g a Tide Dash
Button would place an order for Tide detergent). We created a simple Python script to run on a jailbroken iPhone that
would listen for a signal from a registered Dash Button and then take picture when it was received.

- [**BrowsVR**](https://devpost.com/software/browsvr)
This project was built for the inaugural SpartaHack, Michigan State's annual hackathon. Using the Oculus Rift, we built
a small scene of a room with a large screen displaying a web browser. As the user visited different sites the room would
update the decor based on the site visited. It was an ambitious idea and won us third place, but the functionality was
fairly limited and I have not worked with an Oculus Rift since.
