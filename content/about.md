Hello, I'm Eric Newman. I grew up in Southeast Michigan, attended Michigan State University from 2012-2016 graduating
with a computer science degree, and following that moved to Chicago where I have lived and worked since. My career has
largely involved working with Ruby on Rails apps, but I also have experience with other dynamic languages such as Python
and Javascript.

I currently work at Northwestern University's Galter Health Sciences Library on the Digital Systems team maintaining the
library website and collaborating on grant funded projects with the Northwestern University Clinical & Translational
Sciences (NUCATS) Institute. Most of time outside of work is currently going towards my graduate studies as I pursue a
graduate certificate in data engineering from Northwestern University's School of Professional Studies, but when I have
the time I love going to Chicago White Sox baseball games, playing Dungeons and Dragons and other tabletop games, and
exploring the city with my wife.

If you would like to read more about my professional experience and education you can view my resume from the link
located on the sidebar of this site. My personal projects and a contact form are also found there.
